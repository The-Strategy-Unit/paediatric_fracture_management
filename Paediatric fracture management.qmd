## Foreword {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

::: small2
In this report we have taken paediatric Emergency department (ED)
attendances (0-16yrs old) across England (2019-23) and looked at a
select number of paediatric fractures where either national guidance or
published/emerging evidence suggests limited intervention, imaging or
follow up is required. These include clavicle (collarbone), forearm and
toe fractures. Given our results we believe future UK wide analysis of
other fracture types and/or a wider age range (Adults) may prove
beneficial.

For paediatric fractures regarded as minor or 'low need', our analysis
demonstrates:

-   If the number of follow up appointments was reduced to the lowest
    quartile of English Trusts circa. 30,000 appointments could be saved
    annually. (Slide 40 & 49)

-   Many clavicle fractures, commonly accepted to heal without
    intervention, have two or more follow up appointments when evidence
    suggests none are required. (Slide 23 & 41)

-   Marked variance exists across Trusts in the proportion of fractures
    with follow up and how that occurs (virtual vs face to face). (Slide
    39-40)

Our analysis demonstrates between 2019-23 the proportion of forearm
fractures manipulated:

-   Has reduced in theatre by 50% (Slide 27) and increased in ED (Slide
    26).

-   Total manipulations (theatre or ED) have reduced by 22% (Slide 28).

Our data shows that forearm fractures are the most common fracture in
children and in 2022-23 alone over 25,000 had no follow up (Slide 23).
Along with the forearm manipulation data this collectively suggests a
fundamental change in forearm fracture management has occurred across
England, likely driven by Get It Right First Time (GIRFT) targets and
recent/ongoing research (FORCE & CRAFFT).

Lastly, our analysis suggests marked regional variation in fracture
incidence exists (Slide 13) and is unaccounted in the current
GIRFT/Model hospital 'Wrist manipulations in theatre' dataset. We have
formulated an alternative and potentially more nuanced version
accounting for regional variation. Interestingly, Trusts currently
considered either in the top or bottom quartiles markedly change
position within our proposed model (Slide 43-44).

In conclusion we believe our analysis can help set future GIRFT targets
driving change and savings across the NHS.

## Report summary {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

This report sets out to understanding the opportunities to reduce
hospital activity through wider adoption of more conservative management
of selected paediatric fractures.

The work was funded by NHS England as part of the New Hospitals
Programme.

This work may provide an opportunity to create a new activity mitigator
in the NHP model to allow trusts to estimate the impact of adopting
conservative management of certain paediatric fractures on their future
activity levels.

Key findings:

-   Over the last 5 years there has been a trend towards more
    conservative management of paediatric fractures, but further
    activity savings that could be made.

-   While nationally manipulations in theatre have decreased in recent
    years, at some trusts there is still scope to reduce the proportion
    of forearm and elbow fractures manipulated in theatre. This could
    further half the number of elbow and forearm manipulations performed
    in England.

-   There is scope to reduce the number of x-rays for clavicle and toe
    fractures in emergency care in England by almost a fifth.

-   There is scope to reduce the number of follow-up appointments for
    elbow, forearm, clavicle, tibia/fibula and toes fractures in England
    by a third.

## Background {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

#### Epidemiology of paediatric fractures

::: small2
One hospital in Ireland calculated a paediatric fracture incidence rate
of approximately 29 fractures/1,000/year^1^. The most common fracture
was distal radial/buckle fractures (27.2%), followed by distal humerus
/supracondylar fracture (13.9%), ankle fractures (9.2%), phalanx
fractures (8.3%), and radial/ulnar metaphysis fractures (5.7%). It is
suggested the incidence rate will depend on the social emphasis on
encouraging physical activity^1^.

Between 2012--2019, 368,120 children under 18 were admitted to English
NHS hospitals with a fracture; 256,008 (69.5%) were upper limb and
85,737 (23.3%) were lower limb fractures^2^. The annual incidence of
upper limb fractures was highest in children aged 5--9 (348.3 per 100,
000 children).

The total fracture incidence rate in the UK was found by one study to be
1,370 fractures per 100,000 children^3^, while another found the
incidence of distal radius fractures to be 337 fractures per 100,000
children at one UK trauma centre^4^.
:::

#### Paediatric fracture management

::: small2
British Society for Children's Orthopaedic Surgery (BSCOS) guidance
suggests that no referral/follow up is required for many fractures of
the clavicle, elbow, wrist and toes where there is no or minimal
displacement^5^.

The FORCE study found in children with a torus fracture of the distal
radius there was no difference in outcomes between those who were
offered of a bandage and immediate discharge (as per UK National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommendations) and those
receiving current treatment of rigid immobilisation and follow-up^6^.

One study in Scotland found that uncomplicated paediatric clavicle
fractures can be managed without x-rays in the ED as the use of x-rays
did not influence fracture management or add valuable information to
clinicians' assessment^7^.

## Background (continued) {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

#### Manipulation of paediatric fractures

::: small2
A GIRFT report on Paediatric Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery found that
over 250 weeks of theatre time a year had been used for manipulation of
forearm fractures between 2016 and 2019^1^. A significant proportion of
these displaced or angulated wrist fractures could have been manipulated
and cast in the emergency department rather than being admitted and
treated in the operating theatre. The GIRFT report found significant
variation between trusts in the number of manipulations being performed
in theatre. If the number of fractures manipulated in theatre at all
trusts was reduced to the level seen in trusts with well-developed
emergency department manipulation protocols there would be an 80%
reduction in manipulations in theatre, reducing theatre time for
forearm/wrist fractures to under 57 weeks.

Due to pressures on hospitals from the COVID-19 pandemic the British
Orthopaedic Association developed guidelines for the early management of
distal forearm fractures in children. A study conducted at one trust
found that the implementation of these guidelines resulted in 86% of
distal forearm fractures in children being manipulated in the emergency
department, an increase from 32% prior to the COVID pandemic^2^. This
saved approximately 63 hours of theatre time in the six-month study
period.

The GIRFT report did highlight reluctance to perform procedures in the
emergency department because of worries about breaching the 4 hour
emergency department treatment target, a lack of space/facilities to
perform sedation and a lack of familiarity with techniques^1^.

## Aims {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

::: summarytext
1)  Add to the information in the literature on the incidence rate of
    various paediatric fractures (forearm, elbow, clavicle, tibia/fibula
    and toe) recorded in emergency care in England.

2)  Understand the trends in management of these fracture types over
    time, e.g. have changes in guidance during COVID-19 changed the
    trends in management of fractures in emergency care.

3)  Investigate the variation in management of these fracture types
    between trusts, and the potential activity savings if there was more
    widespread conservative management, such as reducing unnecessary
    follow-ups appointments and manipulation in the emergency department
    rather than in theatre.
:::

## Data sources and Study population {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

::: small2
The study population included all those aged 16 and under who attended
an emergency care centre in England between April 2019 and March 2024
and had a SNOMED code for a closed fracture of toe, clavicle, elbow,
forearm or tibia/fibula recorded (see Appendices A-C for full code
lists).

Records at a patient level were taken from the Emergency Care dataset
(ECDS) and linked with any subsequent fracture related activity recorded
in the Outpatient (OPA) and Admitted Patient Care Episode (APCE)
datasets in the 3 months post-emergency care attendance. All data were
accessed through the National Commissioning Data Repository (NCDR).

This study focuses on closed fractures as this is where there is scope
for more conservative management; open, pathological, osteoporotic and
birth trauma fractures have been excluded, alongside fractures of the
great toe, which should all be followed up.

Incidence rates were calculated using the Office of National Statistics
(ONS) mid-year population estimates by age and sex^1^.

The coding of fractures is not sufficiently detailed and reliable to
determine specific fracture types, and thus what would be the
appropriate treatment at an individual patient level. For example, we
cannot identify buckle fractures, which we know could be treated more
conservatively. However, we could calculate the proportion of children
with each fracture type that:

-   had a fracture manipulated in theatre (only includes closed
    manipulations; those requiring internal fixation and
    re-manipulations are excluded)
-   had a fracture manipulated in the emergency department
-   received a follow-up outpatient appointment
-   had a referral/appointment for physiotherapy
-   had an X-ray in the emergency department

Full details of the coding used to identify these procedures/attendances
is included in Appendix D.

## Incidence rates {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

Incidence rates were calculated to get a better understanding of the the
scale of paediatric fracture attendances in emergency care, including

-   trends over time

-   the most common fracture types, and how these vary by age and sex

-   Variation by region to determine whether there may be a greater
    burden of fractures in some ICB areas

These incidence rates are not the incidence of fractures, but should be
considered as the incidence of a recorded emergency care attendance for
the specified closed fracture types.

The crude annual incidence rates per 100,000 children were calculated
using ONS mid-year population estimates, broken down by age and sex.

The majority of fractures are recorded within the emergency care dataset
under just a few snomed codes.

There are codes available that specify whether a radius fracture is
proximal or distal, but these are not used, instead the general code
'Closed fracture of radius (disorder)' is used. We have classified this
as a forearm fracture but some of these might be proximal radius
fractures and therefore more accurately classified at elbow fractures.

Fractures of great toe were excluded as these should be followed up,
however \<10 codes related to the fracture of the great toe were
recorded over the whole 5 year period in England, suggesting that many
of great toe fractures may be coded as 'Closed fracture of phalanx of
foot (disorder)' and thus included within our dataset.

Incidence rates are based on the number of attendances within the ICB
area, regardless of whether those attending are resident in the area,
relative to the resident population. This is to indicate the potential
burden on emergency care services within the ICB area.

For all fracture types the incidence rates are high in the Cornwall and
Isles of Scilly ICB area.

There are also generally high rates of several fracture types in the
Gloucester ICB, Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin ICB and Hereford and
Worcestershire ICB areas. In these areas it is possible the higher
incidence rates may at least in part be due to those living in Wales
accessing emergency care centres in these areas.

The incidence rate is generally lowest is the South East of England,
particularly in the London area.

While lower rates in some areas will be the result of some trusts in
those areas not reliably recording diagnoses codes for emergency care
attendances there is evidence of variation in incidence rates by ICB.
For example, diagnoses rates are high in both the Cornwall and
Leicestershire ICB areas, but incidence rates are considerably lower in
the Leicestershire ICB area compared to Cornwall.

There is considerable variability between providers in the percentage
emergency care attendances where a fracture is recorded. Even when
accounting for the different rates of recording diagnoses seen between
trusts, the percentage of diagnoses that are fractures varies
considerably.

These differences could be due to:

-   Alternative provision locally, e.g. in some areas there is
    independent urgent care provision available.

-   Regional differences in fracture rate, which may be related to
    levels of physical activity, visitors from out of area and the
    demographic of the area.

-   Issues with coding/reporting, including variation in what diagnoses
    are recorded.

The incidence rate in Cornwall is higher year round compared to England
as a whole. However, in the summer months (June-Aug, highlighted in
yellow) the incidence rate in Cornwall increases more than in England as
a whole; in Cornwall the summer incidence rate is on average 78% higher
than in the winter, whereas for England as it is 66% higher. Therefore
some of the higher incidence rate in Cornwall may be as a result of
tourism in the summer months.

Only one trust in the Cornwall ICB area provides emergency care and in
2022/23 they recorded diagnoses codes for over 99% of emergency care
attendances, so this will be contributing to the higher rate seen in
Cornwall, as nationally only 70% of attendances had diagnoses codes
recorded in 2022/23.

## Summary of analysis of incidence rates {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

-   In children, forearm fractures are the most common followed by elbow
    fractures.

-   Fractures of tibia/fibula are most common in under 5. Elbow
    fractures are most common in 5-10 year olds. For older children the
    fracture rate is higher in boys compared to girls, with boys aged
    11-16 years having the highest rates of clavicle, forearm and toe
    fractures.

-   There is significant seasonality with much higher fractures rates
    seen in the summer months, likely related to increased outdoor
    physical activity.

-   Incidence rates vary considerably by ICB region and by trust. Some
    of these differences will be due to issues with coding and reporting
    of fractures, as the proportion of emergency care attendances
    without a diagnosis code recorded varies significantly between
    trusts. However, some of the differences seen between trusts are
    likely related to availability of alternative provision locally
    (independent urgent treatment centres or alternative specialist
    paediatric provision nearby) or due to differences between areas in
    the patient demographic and in levels of physical activity.

-   Lack of detailed coding of fractures means some fractures may be
    misclassified, e.g. it is not possible to determine which radius
    fractures may be more accurately classified as elbow rather than
    forearm fractures, and great toe fractures are not specifically
    recorded.

## Exploring fracture management {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

There have been recent studies and guidance suggesting a more
conservative approach to managing paediatric fractures should be
adopted. Therefore we set out to consider whether paediatric fracture
management has changed over the last 5 years.

<br>

We have investigated:

-   The proportion of fracture that are x-rayed within the emergency
    department

-   The proportion of fractures that receive an outpatient follow-up
    appointment, which could be an outpatient or physiotherapy
    appointment.

-   The types of follow-up appointments, including looking specifically
    at physiotherapy appointments.

-   The proportion of fractures being manipulated and the trends in
    manipulations in both the emergency department and in theatre.

Follow-up rates are lower for toe and clavicle fractures, and highest
for tibia/fibula and elbow fractures.

In the past 5 years, there has been over a 10% reduction in the
proportion of emergency department attendances for clavicle and forearm
where a follow-up appointment is given.

has decreased, especially following COVID-19.

The proportion of follow-up outpatient appointments with no procedures

tibia/fibula and elbow fractures there was a slight increase in the
proportion of these follow-ups at the start of the pandemic which has
remained in the post-pandemic.

The majority of procedures are related to casts/bandages/splints, and
the numbers of these have decreased post-pandemic, as has the number of
diagnostic imaging procedures during follow-up appointments. This likely
indicates a move towards more conservative management of fractures, and
to be expected with an increased proportion of follow-ups being
conducted virtually.

There are also some procedures of joint (OPCS code W92) recorded in
these outpatient follow-up appointments (this code includes procedures
such as: distension of joint, examination of joint including under image
intensifier or anaesthetic, chemical or radiation synovectomy)

The number of manipulations recorded during outpatient appointments is
extremely small.

It is fairly common for more than one procedure to be recorded.

Logistic regression was used to determine which variables are independently associated with a follow-up appointment being given. This allows us to identify which characteristics and thus which groups of children are more or less likely to be given a follow-up appointment. An odds ratio of greater than 1 indicates an increased chance of having a follow-up appointment compared to the reference group, while an odds ratio below 1 indicates a reduced chance of a follow-up.

Children are more likely to be given a follow-up appointment
(outpatient/physiotherapy) if they are

-   male

-   11-16 years old

-   from an asian or black background

-   living in a less deprived area

They are also more likely to have a follow-up appointment if they
attended

-   an emergency department

-   on a weekend

-   at nighttime

Those attending in more recent years were less likely to have a
follow-up appointment, even after attempting to adjust for case-mix,
further indicating there has been a move towards fewer follow-up
appointments.

A greater proportion of those attending emergency departments, compared
to urgent treatment centres, have their fractures manipulated in the
emergency department, which is to be expected given that manipulations
would generally not be done within an urgent treatment centres.

However, the percentage of fractures manipulated in theatre is also
higher for those attending emergency departments, suggesting those with
more obvious/complex fractures that require manipulation are more likely
to attend emergency departments, or be sent there from urgent treatment
centres (in a small number of cases where a child attended 2 emergency
care sites on the same day, we have only included the second
attendance).

<br>

In 2022/23, 73% of fractures were seen in the emergency department, and
27% in urgent treatment centres.

However, 90% of fractures requiring manipulations were seen in the
emergency department and around 10% in urgent treatment centres, further
indicating that those with fractures that require manipulation are more
likely to attend an emergency department rather than an urgent treatment
centre.

Logistic regression was used to allow us to identify which characteristics and thus which groups of children are more or less likely to have their forearm fracture manipulated in theatre.

Includes only forearm fractures that are manipulated, either the
emergency department or in theatre (excludes those where manipulation is
recorded in both ED and theatre) to determine what factors might be
influencing the decision to manipulate a fracture in theatre rather than
in the emergency department.

Children are more likely to have a fracture manipulated in theatre if
they are

-   female

-   under the age of 5

-   white

-   living in a more deprived area

They are also more likely to have a manipulation in theatre if they
attended

-   an urgent treatment centre

-   on a weekend

-   at nighttime

-   in the summer

Those attending in more recent years were less likely to have their
fracture manipulated in theatre, even after attempting to adjust for
case-mix, further indicating there has been a move towards manipulating
more fractures in the emergency department.

## Summary of management of fractures {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

-   For upper limb fractures there has been a slight reduction in the
    number given a follow up appointment. For all fracture types there
    there has been a significant increase in the proportion of follow-up
    appointments conducted virtually since the pandemic.
-   Those presenting at night and at weekends were more likely to have
    follow up appointments and have their fracture manipulated in
    theatre. While it may be that those with more obvious/complex
    fractures that require manipulation/follow-up are more likely to
    present at these times, rather than perhaps waiting until the next
    day, it may also be the result of less senior staff available at
    these times.
-   There has been a decrease post-pandemic in the number of outpatient
    procedures involving casts/splints/bandages and a decrease in
    diagnostic imaging in outpatients.
-   Over the last 5 years the proportion of fractures manipulated in
    theatre has decreased and the proportion manipulated in the
    emergency department has increased.
-   Those attending urgent treatment centres are more likely to have
    their fractures manipulated in theatre as this would generally not
    be possible at urgent treatment centres. Although the majority of
    fractures that require manipulation are seen in emergency
    departments.
-   The overall manipulation rate for forearm fractures has reduced over
    the last 5 years, which likely reflects a change in the culture,
    with displaced fractures now less likely to be manipulated. Indeed,
    the CRAFFT study is currently looking at whether there is a
    difference in outcomes between surgical reduction versus
    non-surgical casting for displaced distal radius fractures in
    children^1^.
-   Overall, there is a trend towards more conservative management of
    paediatric fractures.

## Opportunities to reduce hospital activity {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

We aimed to determine the scale of the potential opportunities to reduce
hospital activity and costs if more conservative management of
paediatric fractures is adopted.

It is not possible from the data to determine the most appropriate
treatment at an individual patient level and exactly which activity
could be reduced.

Some trusts are known to have adopted more conservative approaches to
fracture management. Therefore, we have compared activity rates across
trusts and calculated activity savings if all trusts reduced their
levels of activity down to the level of the best performing trusts that
may already be using more conservative management approaches.

Potential activity reductions considered:

-   reducing the percentage of emergency care attendances for toe and
    clavicle fractures where an x-ray is performed.

-   reducing the percentage of fractures where a follow-up outpatient
    appointment is given.

-   reducing the percentage of forearm and elbow fractures where a
    manipulation is performed in theatre.

For x-rays and outpatient attendances we have considered a reduction in
activity down to the level of the lowest decile of trusts. However, for
manipulations in theatre we have used the lowest quartile as there has
already been a significant reduction in these over past 5 years and
rates of manipulations in theatre are already low at many trusts.

## Calculating proportions by trust {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

Includes only NHS trusts with 120+ attendances for fractures in 2022/23;
this resulted in 8 trusts being excluded. Some trusts may have low
numbers due to alternative provisions locally e.g. Royal Liverpool had
small numbers which is unsurprising given its proximity to a specialist
paediatric centre at Alder Hey. Independent providers were also
excluded, the majority of these had small numbers of attendances for
fractures (\<120 per year).

```
:::
:::

All attendances at urgent treatment centres are costed at £85 regardless
on whether a fracture is x-rayed.

For both clavicle and toe fractures without an x-ray the median cost of
an emergency department attendance is £`r median_without_xray$cost`
compared to a median cost of £`r median_with_xray$cost` when the
fracture is x-rayed, suggesting a saving in the region of
£`r difference` for each clavicle or toe fracture not x-rayed in the
emergency department.

This may be an underestimation as some children may have more than one

<br> This includes all outpatient attendances, including physiotherapy
appointments, in the 3 months post-fracture.

There is significant variability between trusts in the number of
follow-up appointments for clavicle fractures.

Many clavicle fractures should not require follow-up yet some trusts are
averaging 2-3 follow-up appointments per clavicle fracture, indicating a
potential to further decrease follow-up appointments if second and
subsequent appointments are considered.

## Differences between our approach and the GIRFT metric {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="100%"}
There are some significant differences between the data included by
GIRFT/Model Hospital and the data used in this study. GIRFT/Model
Hospital:

-   include all forearm and wrist fractures, whereas we excluded certain
    fracture types, e.g open fractures which are assumed to all require
    treatment in theatre.

-   include re-manipulations in theatre, whilst we have excluded those
    coded as re-manipulations.

-   use a 3-year average, whilst we used only the most recent year where
    follow-up data is available (2022/23).

-   use the number of fractures manipulated in theatres taken directly
    from inpatient data and total A&E attendances for those aged 16 and
    under as the denominator. We have linked emergency care data to
    inpatient data and so are only considering manipulations in theatre
    for patients identified in the emergency care dataset as having a
    fracture.
    
The way the GIRFT metric is calculated means that it does not account for any regional differences in fractures rates, but it is unaffected by the poor recording of diagnoses codes in emergency care. Our measure accounts for regional differences, but does rely on the assumption that the fracture types requiring interventions and fractures that do not are equally likely have a diagnosis code recorded in emergency care, which may not always be the case.

Graphs show our data for the number of forearm fractures manipulated in
theatre in 2022/2023 (identified by linking to emergency care fracture
records), but use different denominators to calculate the rate.

**Top figure** shows the 20 trusts with the highest (red) and 20 trusts
with the lowest (green) rates of manipulations in theatre using total
A&E attendances as the denominator.

**Bottom figure** uses the number of A&E attendances for forearm
fractures as the denominator, and the same trusts labelled above are
shown in their new positions according to this new metric. We have used
this method to calculate manipulation rates in the subsequent slides, as
it accounts for differences between trusts in the proportion of
emergency department attendances that are for fractures. However, as
diagnoses codes are not always recorded using this method we do have to
make the assumption that the fractures that are recorded are
representative to true case-mix.

Example 1, using total A&E attendances as the denominator The Royal
Cornwall Hospitals Trust has a rate of \~16.6 forearm manipulations in
theatre/10,000 A&E attendances, which puts it as the 11th highest rate
in England. Using the number of forearm fractures as the denominator the
manipulation rate of forearm fractures in theatre is 5.9%, moving The
Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust out of the highest quartile down to 43rd
highest.

Example 2, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation trust has a
rate of 1.3 forearm manipulations in theatre/10,000 A&E attendances,
which is the 16th lowest rate in England. However, when the number of
forearm fractures is used as the denominator the rate of forearm
manipulations in theatre is 6%, suggesting the trust doesn't actually
perform as well as first thought, moving it to the 42nd highest, with a
similar rate to The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust.

## Summary of the potential activity reductions {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

-   There is scope for a 19% reduction in the number of x-rays for
    clavicle and toe fractures in emergency care in England, equivalent
    to at least 4,400 x-rays per year.

-   The number of follow-up appointments for forearm, elbow, clavicle,
    tibia/fibula and toe fractures could be reduced by 33%, equivalent
    to at least 28,800 follow-ups per year in England. This is based on
    reducing the number of first follow-ups, but it appears a number of
    children have more than one unnecessary follow-up so this is likely
    an underestimate of the potential savings.

-   The number of forearm and elbow fractures manipulated in theatre
    could be reduced by an additional 55%, equivalent to a reduction of
    1,900 manipulations in theatre in England per year. Assuming
    manipulation of a forearm/elbow fracture takes on average 45
    mins^1,2^, this equates to 8.5 weeks of theatre time per year.

-   While some trusts have already implemented more conservative
    management approaches, particularly for manipulations, there appear
    to be some trusts that could still significantly benefit from
    adopting this approach. At many trusts there is significant scope to
    reduce number of x-rays performed for fractured clavicles and toes
    and the number of follow-up appointments for all fracture types.

## Discussion {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

::: small2
In agreement with previous studies we find forearm fractures are the
most common followed by elbow fractures, and also higher fractures
incidences in the summer and older boys due to higher levels of physical
activity^1,2^. We find geographical variation in the recorded incidences
of fractures in emergency care, some of this is likely the result of
poor recording of fractures in emergency care in some areas. However, a
previous paper found significant geographical variation with lower rates
in London, similar to our results^1^. It is thought that regional
variation may be due to levels of physical activity, obesity levels and
the ethnic make up of the area; fracture rates were found to be higher
in white children compared to those of black or South Asian ethnicity
and to correlate with obesity and levels of physical activity^1^.

In the Paediatric Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery GIRFT report it was
suggested that there was scope to reduce the number of paediatric
forearm manipulations in theatre by 80%^3^. That study used data from
2016-2019, in our study we have found since 2019/2020 the proportion of
forearm fractures manipulated in theatre has fallen by 54%, from just
over 8% in 2019/20 to under 4% in 2023/24.

It appears that there is the possibility to further reduce manipulations
in theatre, particularly at some trusts, although overall at a national
level the decrease in manipulation in theatre is likely to start slowing
as the numbers get smaller. The switch to manipulating more fractures in
the emergency department rather than in theatre will not only would save
the NHS money, operating theatre time and resources, but will improve
care for children and their families as treatment is quicker and less
disruptive.

As highlighted within the Paediatric Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery
GIRFT report there are a number of factors that may be reduce the
proportion of manipulations in the emergency department, including
concerns about breach times, a lack of space/facilities to perform
sedation, and a lack of familiarity with techniques^3^. Concerns around
litigation may also lead to less conservative management, especially
with elbow fractures which can lead to rare, but severe, complications.
It is possible factors related to culture, lack of experience and
litigation may also influence conservative management when it comes to
reducing x-rays for clavicle and toe fractures and reducing follow-up
appointments.

Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, who are known to utilise more
conservative management of paediatric fractures including routinely
manipulating forearm fractures in the emergency department^3,4^, have,
as expected, one of the lowest proportions of forearm fractures
manipulated in theatre. In 2022/2023 only 0.5% of forearm fractures were
manipulated in theatre (while 11.81% were manipulated in the emergency
department) meaning only 4% of all forearm fractures requiring
manipulation were performed in theatre. In terms of follow-up
appointments 57% of forearm fractures receive a follow-up appointment,
which is just above the lowest quartile.

## Discussion (continued) {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

::: small2
While at a national level the scope for significant further reductions
in manipulations in theatre is likely to become limited, there is
perhaps more scope in the future to reduce activity in terms of reducing
unnecessary x-rays in the emergency department for clavicle and toe
fractures, and in reducing the number of follow-up appointments.

The total number of forearm fractures that are manipulated has been
decreasing, and there is perhaps scope for this to decrease further.
Indeed, the CRAFFT study being conducted at over 45 sites in England is
investigating whether there are any differences in outcomes between
surgical reduction versus non-surgical casting for displaced distal
radius fractures in children^1^.

The GIRFT report found some trusts have moved towards splinting
fractures in the emergency department with a virtual follow-up, rather
than a temporary cast and then referral to a fracture clinic^1^. From
our data the use of virtual follow-ups appears widespread, but there may
be scope to reduce virtual appointments, especially as some trusts with
high overall follow-up rates have a particularly high number of virtual
appointments.

Evidence suggests that many x-rays of clavicle fractures are unnecessary
as they tend to not add significantly to a clinician's assessment or
alter management^2^. However, almost all trusts still are x-raying the
vast majority of potential clavicle fractures so the proportion of
x-rays is still high even for the lowest decile of trusts (77%).
Therefore our numbers are likely to be an underestimate of what activity
savings could be potentially achieved. The same is likely true for toe
fractures. It has been found that while most more experienced clinicians
were comfortable treating clavicle fractures without x-rays, more junior
clinicians were not^2^.

Our absolute number estimates of reductions in activity may be an
underestimate, because diagnoses are not reliably being recorded by some
trusts in the emergency department. It is also possible that there may
be some bias on the types of fractures attending emergency care that are
given a diagnosis code. For example, it is possible at trusts that do
not consistently record diagnosis codes in emergency care may be more
likely to record fractures requiring manipulation than those that do not
require manipulation or follow-up. However, when looking at trusts there
was no significant relationship between the proportion of emergency care
attendances without diagnosis codes and the proportion of fractures
manipulated in theatre.

This report does highlight the need for more accurate and consistent
recording of diagnoses in emergency care.

## Limitations {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

::: small2
We are relying on the coding/reporting of fractures, manipulations,
x-rays and outpatient appointments within the the SUS datasets. Some of
the variability in the number of fractures, x-rays, physiotherapy
referrals, follow-up appointments and manipulations between trusts and
over time could be due to issues with the coding.

As diagnosis code is not always recorded in the emergency care dataset
our incidence rates give the incidence of fractures recorded in
emergency care, and only include closed fractures, open fractures were
excluded.

The coding of fractures is not specific enough to determine at an
individual level which fractures could be managed more conservatively,
so we are relying on comparing proportion between trusts, but but we
can't be sure whether all trusts have a similar proportion of more
complex fractures that do require manipulation and follow-up.

There will be a small number of cases where a child has more than one
fracture or other injuries recorded in emergency care (\<1%), so it is
possible any follow-up appointments or manipulations could potentially
be for a different injury/fracture sustained at the same time.

Data is allocated to the trust where the child attended the emergency
department, e.g. if a child first attended the emergency department at
trust A while on holiday but subsequently received follow-up
appointments at trust B the fracture and subsequent follow-up would be
included in the data for trust A.

The number of elbow manipulations recorded in theatre appears lower than
would be expected, which may be due to coding issues. The lack of
detailed coding of fractures makes it difficult to determine what is an
elbow fracture and may mean that some are classified as forearm
fractures, e.g. the SNOMED code for 'Closed fracture of radius
(disorder)' is the most commonly used, and while we have classified
these as forearm fractures, fractures of the proximal radius would be
considered an elbow fracture. This may in part explain why we see a
smaller number of elbow manipulations in theatre than would be expected,
as they are included within forearm fractures. Also, HRG groupings for
manipulations in theatre do not distinguish between forearm and elbow
procedures, so it is not possible to determine from these which are
forearm and which are elbow manipulations. We have only considered elbow
manipulations in theatre that could be conducted in the emergency
department, i.e. those without internal fixation such as wires or pins.
Therefore our elbow manipulation number might also be affect by the
propensity of individual trusts to use internal fixation for elbow
fractures. We have also not included re-manipulations in our data.

These potential reductions in activity are for England only, but there
is likely also the potential for activity savings in the other countries
of the UK.

Cost savings are calculated from HRG prices and are only indicative
estimates of potential cost savings.
:::

## Future work {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

To fully understand the potential cost savings of these reductions in
activity a full health economic analysis would be required.

It may be helpful to do some more detailed mapping and analysis of
patient pathways to better understand how fractures are being managed,
and where further activities savings could be made with more
conservative management.

There are currently trends towards more conservative management,
particularly regarding increasing manipulations in the emergency
department, so there is scope to investigate the extent to which these
trends could continue and further activity can be reduced.

Future work could also focus on understanding the degree in variation
between trusts in the proportion of forearm and elbow fractures that are
manipulated in theatre with the use of internal fixation, and whether
there are fractures that could be manipulated without the need for
internal fixation.
