## Background (continued) {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

#### Epidemiology of paediatric fractures

::: small
One hospital in Ireland calculated a paediatric fracture incidence rate of approximately 29 fractures/1,000/year^1^. The most common fracture was distal radial/buckle fractures (27.2%), followed by distal humerus /supracondylar fracture (13.9%), ankle fractures (9.2%), phalanx fractures (8.3%), and radial/ulnar metaphysis fractures (5.7%). It is suggested the incidence rate will depend on the social emphasis on encouraging physical activity^1^.

Between 2012--2019, 368,120 children under 18 were admitted to English NHS hospitals with a fracture; 256,008 (69.5%) were upper limb and 85,737 (23.3%) were lower limb fractures^2^. The annual incidence of upper limb fractures was highest in children aged 5--9 (348.3 per 100 000 children).
:::

#### Paediatric fracture management

::: small
British Society for Children's Orthopaedic Surgery (BSCOS) guidance suggests that no referral/follow up is required for many fractures of the clavicle, elbow, wrist and toes where there is no or minimal displacement^3^.

The FORCE study found in children with a torus fracture of the distal radius there was no difference in outcomes between those who were offered of a bandage and immediate discharge (as per UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommendations) and those receiving current treatment of rigid immobilisation and follow-up^4^.

One study in Scotland found that uncomplicated paediatric clavicle fractures can be managed without x-rays in the ED as they do not influence fracture management or add valuable information to clinicians' assessment^5^.

## Background (continued) {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

#### Manipulation of paediatric fractures

::: small
A GIRFT report on Paediatric Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery found that over 250 weeks of operating time a year had been dedicated to manipulation of the forearm and wrist between 2016 and 2019^1^. A significant proportion of these displaced or angulated wrist fractures could have been manipulated and cast in the emergency department rather than being admitted and treated in the operating theatre. The GIRFT report found significant variation between trusts in the number of manipulating being performed in theatre. If the number of fractures manipulated in theatre was reduced to the level in trusts with well-developed ED manipulation protocols, there would be an 80% reduction in manipulations in theatre, reducing theatre time for forearm/wrist fractures to 57 weeks or less.

Due to pressures on hospitals from the COVID-19 pandemic the British Orthopaedic Association developed guidelines for the early management of distal forearm fractures in children. A study conducted at one trust found following the implementation of these guidelines resulted in 86% of distal forearm fractures in children were manipulated in the ED, an increase from 32% prior to the COVID pandemic^2^. This saved approximately 63 hours of theatre time in the six-month study period.

The GIRFT report highlighted reluctance to perform procedures in the emergency department because of worries about breach times, a lack of space/facilities to perform sedation and a lack of familiarity with techniques^1^.

## Aims {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

1)  Update and add to the information in the literature on the epidemiology/incidence rate of various paediatric fractures (toe, clavicle, wrist and elbow) in England.

2)  Understand the trends in management of these fracture types over time, e.g. have changes in guidance during COVID-19 changed the trends in management of fractures in Emergency departments.

3)  Investigate the variation in management of these fracture types between trusts, and the potential activity and cost savings if there was more widespread conservative management, such as reducing unnecessary follow-ups appointments and manipulation in the Emergency Department rather than in theatre.

## Data sources and Study population {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

::: small
Data were taken from the Emergency care dataset (ECDS) and linked with records in the Outpatient and Admitted Patient Care Episode (APCE) datasets, all accessed through the National Commissioning Data Repository (NCDR).

The study population included all those aged 16 and under that attended an emergency care centre and had a SNOMED code for closed fractures of toe, clavicle, elbow or wrist recorded (see Appendices A-C for full code lists) in England between April 2018 and March 2024.

This study focuses on closed fractures as this is where there is scope for more conservative management; open, pathological, osteoporotic and birth trauma fractures have been excluded, alongside fractures of the great toe which should all be followed up.

Incidence rates were calculated using the Office of National Statistics (ONS) mid-year population estimates of those aged 16 years and under^1^.

The coding of fractures is not sufficiently detailed and reliable to determine specific fracture types, and thus what would be the appropriate treatment at an individual patient level. However, we could calculate the proportion of children with each fracture type that:

-   received a follow-up appointment
-   had a fracture manipulated in theatre (only includes closed manipulations and not re-manipulations)
-   had a fracture manipulated in the emergency department
-   had a referral/appointment for physiotherapy
-   had an X-ray in the emergency department

Full details of the coding used to identify these procedures/attendances is included in Appendix D.

The majority of fractures are recorded within the emergency care dataset under just a few snomed codes.

There are codes available that specify whether a radius fracture is proximal or distal, but these are not used, instead the general code 'Closed fracture of radius (disorder)' is used. We have classified this as a forearm fracture but some of these fractures might be proximal radius and more accurately classified at elbow fractures.

Fractures of great toe was excluded as these should be followed up, however \<10 codes related to the fracture of the great toe were recorded over the whole 6 yr period in England, suggesting that many of great toe fractures may be coded as 'Closed fracture of phalanx of foot (disorder)' and thus included within our dataset.

Incidence rates are based on the number of attendances within the ICB area, regardless of whether those attending are resident in the area, relative to the resident population.

For all fracture types the incidence rates are high in the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly ICB area.

There are also generally high rates of several fracture types in the Gloucester ICB, Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin ICB and Hereford and Worcestershire ICB areas. In these areas it is possible the higher incidence rates may at least in part be due to those living in Wales accessing emergency care centres in these areas.

The fracture incidence rate is generally lowest is the South East of England, particularly in the London area.

There is considerable variability between providers in the number fractures seen per 10,000 emergency care attendances.

These differences could be due to:

-   Alternative provision locally e.g. very few children attend the Royal Liverpool hospital with fractures as it is located close to Alder Hey, a specialist paediatric centre. Or an independent urgent care provision available locally.

-   Difference in fracture rates in different areas e.g. higher rates in Cornwall and generally lower rate in the London area, which may be related levels of physical activity/visitors from out of area.

-   Coding/reporting issues resulting in not all fractures being recorded in the emergency departments.

The incidence rate in Cornwall is higher year round compared to England as a whole. However, in the summer months the fracture incidence rate in Cornwall increases more than in England as a whole; in Cornwall the summer incidence rate is on average 78% higher than in the winter, whereas for England as it is 66%. Therefore some of the higher incidence rate in Cornwall may be as a result of tourism in the summer months.

## Summary of analysis of incidence rates {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

-   In children forearm fractures are the most common followed by elbow fractures.

-   Fractures of tibia/fibula are most common in under 5, and elbow fractures are most common in 5-10 yr olds. For older children the fracture rate is higher in boys compared to girls, with boys aged 11-16 yrs having the highest rates of clavicle, forearm and toe fractures.

-   There is significant seasonality with much higher fractures rates seen in the summer months, likely related to increased outdoor physical activity.

-   Fracture incidence rates vary considerably by ICB region, with high incidence rates in Cornwall and lower rates in London areas. Incidence rates also vary considerable by trust. It is possible some of these differences could be due to issues with coding and reporting of fractures. However, some of the differences are likely related to availablity of alternative provision locally (specialist paediatric centre or independent urgent treatment centre nearby) or due to differences in fracture rates related to different levels of physical activity.

-   Lack of detailed coding of fractures means some fractures may be misclassified, e.g. it is not possible to determine which radius fractures may be more accurately classified as elbow rather than wrist/forearm fractures, and great toe fractures are not specifically recorded.

Over the last 6 yrs the proportion of patients with a fracture that have a follow-up appointment where a procedure is recorded has decreased, especially following COVID-19.

The proportion of patients with a follow-up appointment with no procedures recorded has remained relatively stable over time. Although for tibia/fibula and elbow fractures there was a slight increase in the proportion of these follow-ups at the start of the pandemic which has remained in the post-pandemic.

It is common for children to have more than one type of procedure recorded

The majority of procedures are related to casts/bandages/splints, and the numbers of these have decreased post-pandemic, as has the number of diagnostic imaging procedures during follow-up appointment. This likely indicates a move towards more conservative management of fractures especially with an increasing proportion of follow-ups being conducted virtually.

Procedures of joint (OPCS code W92) includes: distension of joint, examination of joint including under image intensifier or anaesthetic, chemical or radiation synovectomy.

The number of manipulations recorded during outpatient appointments is extremely small.

There is a trend towards a greater proportion of fractures being seen in urgent treatment/ walk-in centres rather than emergency departments.

## Summary of management of fractures {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

-   For upper limb fractures there has been a slight reduction in the number given a follow up appointment. For all fracture types there there has been a significant increase in the proportion of follow-up appointments conducted virtually since the pandemic.
-   Those presenting at night and at weekends were more likely to have follow up appointments and have their fracture manipulated in theatre. While it may be that those with more obviously/complex fractures that require manipulation/follow-up are more likely to present at these times, rather than perhaps waiting until the next day, it is likely also the result of less senior staff available at these times.
-   There has been a decrease post-pandemic in the number of outpatient procedures involving casts/splints/bandages and a decrease in diagnostic imaging in outpatients.
-   Over the last 6 years the proportion of fractures manipulated in theatre has decreased and the proportion manipulated in the emergency department has increased. 
-   Those attending urgent treatment centres are more likely to have their fractures manipulated in theatre as this would generally not be possible at an urgent treatment centre. There is a trend for more fractures to be seen in urgent treatment centres, and while it appears that most of the fractures requiring manipulation are seen in ED rather than UTCs, a continued trend to seeing more fractures in UTCs may in the future impact the ability of trusts to further move away from manipulations in theatre.
-   The overall manipulation rate for forearm fractures has reduced over the last 6 years, which likely reflects a change in the culture, with displaced fractures now less likely to be manipulated. Indeed, the CRAFFT study is currently looking at whether there is a difference in outcomes between surgical reduction versus non-surgical casting for displaced distal radius fractures in children^1^.
-   Overall, there is a trend towards more conservative management of paediatric fractures.

Some trusts may have low numbers due to alternative provisions locally e.g. Royal Liverpool had small numbers which is unsurprising given its proximity to a specialist paediatric provision at Alder Hey. Independent providers were also excluded, the majority of these had small numbers of attendances for fractures, i.e. <120 per year.

## X-rays for Clavicle and Toes fractures by trust {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

```
:::
:::

All attendances at urgent treatment centres are costed at £85 regardless on whether a fracture is x-rayed.

For both clavicle and toe fractures without an x-ray the median cost of an emergency department attendance is £`r median_without_xray$cost` compared to a median cost of £`r median_with_xray$cost` when the fracture is x-rayed, suggesting a saving of £`r difference` for each clavicle or toe fracture not x-rayed in the emergency department.

## Comparing GIRFT/Model Hospital metric to our data- 2022/23 {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
::: {.small}
Firstly, there are some significant differences between the data included by GIRFT/Model Hospital and the data used in this study. GIRFT/Model Hospital:

-   include all forearm and wrist fractures, whereas we excluded certain fracture types, e.g open fractures which are assumed to all require treatment in theatre.

-   include re-manipulations in theatre, whilst we have excluded these.

-   use a 3-year average, whilst we used only the most recent year where follow-up data is available (2022/23).

The GIRFT/Model Hospital metric uses the total A&E attendances for those aged 16 and under as the denominator. Since, we find the fracture incidence rates vary by ICB region and the proportion of emergency department attendances for fractures vary by trust, we have used the number of each fracture type as the denominator, rather than the number of emergency department attendances.

Using the GIRFT/Model Hospital denominator of A&E attendances The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust has a manipulation rate of \~16.6 forearm manipulations/10,000 A&E attendances, putting it the 4th quartile with the 11th highest rate. Using our metric with the number of forearm fractures as the denominator we find 5.9% of forearm fractures are manipulated in theatre, putting The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust within the 3rd quartile (39th highest). This is unsurprising given the Cornwall ICB area has a high forearm fracture rate compared to many other regions; The Royal Cornwall Hospital has a rate of 512 fractures (forearm,elbow,clavicle, toe and tibia/fibula combined) per 10,000 attendances.

There could be an **annual reduction in England of `r calculating_saving( "Elbow")`** (`r calculating_percentage_change("Elbow")`%) manipulations in theatre, if all trusts reduced their percentage to the level of the lowest quartile (`r calculating_lowest_quartile("Elbow")`%). This size of reduction is unlikely to have a significant impact in freeing up theatre time.

For both forearm and elbow fractures the median cost of an emergency care attendance when a fracture is manipulated in the emergency department £`r median_with_manipulation$cost` compared to a median cost of £`r median_without_manipulation$cost` when the fracture is not manipulated in emergency care, suggesting an increased cost of £`r manipulation_difference` for manipulating a fracture in the emergency department.

The median cost of manipulating a forearm fracture in theatre is £`r format(mean(theatre_cost_forearm$median_cost), big.mark=",")` and the median cost for an elbow fracture is £`r format(mean(theatre_cost_elbow$median_cost), big.mark=",")`.

This suggests a cost saving of £`r format((mean(theatre_cost_forearm$median_cost)-manipulation_difference), big.mark=",")` for each forearm fracture and £`r format((mean(theatre_cost_elbow$median_cost)-manipulation_difference), big.mark=",")` for each elbow fracture manipulated in the emergency department, alongside the benefit of freeing up theatre time.

It show be noted that this chart is showing data from the most recent year, 2023-24, rather than 2022/23 which was used for the previous analysis as it ensured we have the full 3-month follow-up period.

## Summary of the potential activity reductions {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}
 

-  A reduction in x-rays in emergency care for clavicle and toe fractures in trusts down to the level of the lowest decile of trusts would reduce the number of x-rays in emergency care in England by around 4,400 per year.

-  A reduction in follow-up appointments for the fracture types studied here down to the level of the lowest decile of trusts would reduce the number of follow-up appointments in England by at least 28,800 per year. This is based on reducing the number of first follow-ups, it is likely that a number of children have more than one unnecessary follow-up so this is likely an underestimate of the potential savings.

- A reduction in the number of forearm and elbow fractures manipulated in theatre down to the level of the lowest quartile would reduce the number of manipulations in theatre in England by 1,900 a year. 

- The number of manipulations in theatre and total number of manipulations, especially for forearm fractures, have significantly decreased over the last 6 years, suggesting previous studies and changes in guidance are having an impact on manipulations. Obviously, some trusts have already implemented more conservative management approaches to paediatric fractures, but there are likely some trusts that could still significantly benefit from adopting this approach.  

- While there has been significant progress in reducing the total number of manipulations and proportion of manipulations in theatre, especially for forearm fractures, there is perhaps also scope to work on reducing the number of fractured clavicles and toes which are x-rayed and in reducing unnecessary follow up appointments.  


## Limitations {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}
:::{.small2}
We are relying on the coding/reporting of fractures and subsequent activity within the the SUS datasets. Some of the variability in the number of fractures, x-rays, physiotherapy referrals, follow-up appointments and manipulations in both theatre and the emergency department could be due to issues with the coding. It is possible some of our numbers may be underestimates due to some activity potentially not being accurately coded, or reported. 

It should be noted that our incidence rates for fractures are only for closed fractures, open fractures were excluded and thus to total incidence rates if including all types of fractures would be higher.

The coding of fractures is not specific enough to determine at an individual level which fractures could be managed more conservatively, so we are relying on comparing proportion between trusts. Some fractures will be more complex and require manipulation and follow-up, but we can't be sure whether all trusts have a similar proportion of more complex fractures. 

Only closed manipulations without internal fixation are included in our data, so if some trusts are treating a higher proportion of fractures with internal fixation then their rate of closed manipulations could appear lower. We have also not included re-manipulations in our data.

There will be a small number of cases where a child has more than one fracture or other injuries, so although have may have classified the fracture as a certain type any follow-up appointments or manipulations could potentially be for a different injury/fracture sustained at the same time.

It should be noted is that data is allocated to the trust where the child attended the emergency department; if a child first attended the emergency department at trust A while on holiday but subsequently received follow-up appointments at trust B once they returned home the fracture and subsequent follow-up would be included in the data for trust A. 

The number of elbow manipulations recorded in theatre appears lower than would be expected, which may be due to coding issues. The lack of specific coding of fractures makes it difficult to determine what is an elbow fracture and may mean that some are classified as forearm fractures, e.g. the SNOMED code for 'Closed fracture of radius (disorder)' is the most commonly used, and while we have classified these as forearm fractures, fractures of the proximal radius would be considered an elbow fracture. This may in part explain why we see a smaller number of elbow manipulations in theatre than would be expected, as they are included within forearm fractures. Also, HRG groupings for manipulations in theatre do not distinguish between forearm and elbow procedures, so it is not possible to determine from these which are forearm and which are elbow.

## Discussion {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}
:::{.small2}
As highlighted within the Paediatric Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery GIRFT report there are a number of factors that may be reduce the proportion of manipulations in the emergency department, including concerns about breach times, a lack of space/facilities to perform sedation, and a lack of familiarity with techniques^1^. Concerns around litigation may also lead to less conservative management, especially with elbow fractures which can lead to rare, but severe, complications. It is possible factors related to culture, lack of experience and litigation may also influence conservative management when it comes to reducing x-rays for clavicle and toe fractures and reducing follow-up appointments. 

Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, who are known to utilise more conservative management of paediatric fractures including routinely manipulating forearm fractures in the emergency department^1,2^, have as expected one of the lowest proportions of forearm fractures manipulated in theatre. In 2022/2023 only 0.5% of forearm fractures were manipulated in theatre (while 11.81% were manipulated in the emergency department) meaning only 4% of all forearm fractures requiring manipulation were performed in theatre. In terms of follow-up appointments 57% of forearm fractures receive a follow-up appointment, which is just above the lowest quartile.

In the Paediatric Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery GIRFT report it was suggested that there was scope to reduce the number of paediatric forearm manipulations in theatre by 80%^1^. That study used data from 2016-2019, in our study we have found since 2018/2019 the proportion of forearm fractures manipulated in theatre has fallen by almost 60%, from 9% in 2018/19 to under 4% in 2023/24.  

It appears that there is the possibility to further reduce manipulations in theatre, particularly at some trusts, but overall at a national level the decrease is likely to start slowing as smaller numbers of fractures are manipulated in theatre. There is perhaps more scope in the future to reduce activity in terms of reducing unnecessary x-rays in the emergency department for clavicle and toe fractures and in reducing the number of follow-up appointments. The total number of forearm fractures that are manipulated has been decreasing, and there is perhaps scope for this to decrease further. Indeed, the CRAFFT study being conducted at over 45 sites in England is investigating whether there are any differences in outcomes between surgical reduction versus non-surgical casting for displaced distal radius fractures in children^3^.

The GIRFT report found some trusts have moved towards splinting fractures in the emergency department with a virtual follow-up, rather than a temporary cast and then referral to a fracture clinic^1^. From our data the use of virtual follow-ups appears widespread, but there may be scope to reduce virtual appointments, especially as some trusts with high overall follow-up rates have a particularly high number of virtual appointments.

## Future work  {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

It may be helpful to do some more detailed mapping and analysis of patient pathways to better understand how fractures are being managed, and where further activities savings could be made with more conservative management. 

There are currently trends towards more conservative management, particularly regarding increasing manipulations in the emergency department, and also towards greater use of urgent treatment centres, so there is further scope to investigate how this may play out in the future, including the extent to which these trends can continue and further activity can be reduced.
