## Background (continued) {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

#### Epidemiology of paediatric fractures

::: small
One hospital in Ireland calculated a paediatric fracture incidence rate of approximately 29 fractures/1,000/year^1^. The most common fracture was distal radial/buckle fractures (27.2%), followed by distal humerus /supracondylar fracture (13.9%), ankle fractures (9.2%), phalanx fractures (8.3%), and radial/ulnar metaphysis fractures (5.7%). It is suggested the incidence rate will depend on the social emphasis on encouraging physical activity^1^.

Between 2012--2019, 368,120 children under 18 were admitted to English NHS hospitals with a fracture; 256,008 (69.5%) were upper limb and 85,737 (23.3%) were lower limb fractures^2^. The annual incidence of upper limb fractures was highest in children aged 5--9 (348.3 per 100 000 children).
:::

#### Paediatric fracture management

::: small
British Society for Children's Orthopaedic Surgery (BSCOS) guidance suggests that no referral/follow up is required for many fractures of the clavicle, elbow, wrist and toes where there is no or minimal displacement^3^.

The FORCE study found in children with a torus fracture of the distal radius there was no difference in outcomes between those who were offered of a bandage and immediate discharge (as per UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommendations) and those receiving current treatment of rigid immobilisation and follow-up^4^.

One study in Scotland found that uncomplicated paediatric clavicle fractures can be managed without x-rays in the ED as they do not influence ultimate management or add valuable information to clinicians' assessment^5^.

## Background (continued) {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

#### Manipulation of paediatric fractures

::: small
A GIRFT report on Paediatric Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery found that over 250 weeks of operating time a year had been dedicated to manipulation of the forearm and wrist between 2016 and 2019^1^. A significant proportion of these displaced or angulated wrist fractures could have been manipulated and cast in the emergency department rather than being admitted and treated in the operating theatre. The GIRFT report found significant variation between trusts in the number of manipulating being performed in theatre; if this number was reduced to the level in trusts with well-developed ED manipulation protocols, there would be an 80% (equivalent this number could be reduced by 80% (to 57 weeks or less).

Due to pressures on hospitals from the COVID-19 pandemic the British Orthopaedic Association developed guidelines for the early management of distal forearm fractures in children. A study conducted at one trust found following the implementation of these guidelines resulted in 86% of distal forearm fractures in children were manipulated in the ED, an increase from 32% prior to the COVID pandemic^2^. This saved approximately 63 hours of theatre time in the six-month study period.

The GIRFT report highlighted reluctance to perform procedures in the emergency department because of worries about breach times, a lack of space/facilities to perform sedation and a lack of familiarity with techniques^1^.

## Aims {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

1)  Update and add to the information in the literature on the epidemiology/incidence rate of various paediatric fractures (toe, clavicle, wrist and elbow) in England.

2)  Understand the trends in management of these fracture types over time, e.g. have changes in guidance during COVID-19 changed the trends in management of fractures in Emergency departments.

3)  Investigate the variation in management of these fracture types between Trusts, and the potential activity and cost savings if there was more widespread conservative management, such as reducing unnecessary follow-ups appointments and manipulation in the Emergency Department rather than in theatre.

## Data sources and Study population {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}
:::{.small}
The data was taken from the Emergency care dataset (ECDS) and linked with records in the Outpatient and Admitted Patient Care Episode (APCE) datasets, all accessed through the National Commissioning Data Repository (NCDR).

The study population included all those aged 16 and under that attended an Emergency care centre and had a SNOMED code for closed fractures of toe, clavicle, elbow or wrist recorded (see Appendices A-C for full code lists) in England between April 2018 and March 2024. 

We have focused on closed fractures as this is where there is scope for more conservative management; we have excluded open, pathological, osteoporotic and birth trauma fractures, alongside fractures of the great toe which should all be followed up. 

Incidence rates were calculated using the Office of National Statistics (ONS) mid-year population estimates of those aged 16 years and under^1^.

The coding of fractures is not sufficiently detailed and reliable to determine specific fracture types, and thus what would be the appropriate treatment at an individual patient level. However, we could calculate the proportion of children with each fracture type that:

-   received a follow-up appointment
-   had a fracture manipulated in theatre
-   had a fracture manipulated in the emergency department
-   had a referral/appointment for physiotherapy
-   had an X-ray in the emergency department

Full details of the coding used to identify these procedures/attendances is included in Appendix D.

There is considerable variability between providers in the number fractures seen per 10,000 emergency care attendances.

These differences could be due
- Alternative provision locally e.g. Very few children attend the Royal Liverpool hospital with fractures as it is located close to Alder Hey, a specialist paediatric centre.
- Difference in fracture rate in different area e.g. higher rates in Cornwall and generally lower rate in the London area
- Coding/reporting issues resulting in not all fractures being recorded in the emergency departments.

In the winter months (Oct-March) Cornwall has a higher incidence rate of fractures compared to England as a whole. However, in the summer months the fracture incidence rate in Cornwall is on average 78% higher than in the winter, whereas for England as a whole the fracture incidence rate in summer is on average 66% higher than in the winter.

It would appear that some of the higher incidence rate in Cornwall is a result on tourism in the summer months.

Over time the proportion of patients with a fracture that have a follow-up appointment with a procedure recorded has decreased, especially following COVID-19, which may be linked to an increase in virtual follow-up appointments.

The proportion of patients with a follow-up appointment with no procedures recorded has remained relatively stable over time. Although for Tibia/Fibula and Elbow fractures there was a slight increase in the proportion of these follow-ups at the start of the pandemic and this increase remained compared to the pre-pandemic period.

The majority of procedures are related to casts/bandages/splints.

Procedures of joint (OPCS code W92) includes: Distension of joint, Examination of joint including under image intensifier or anaesthetic, Chemical or Radiation synovectomy

There is a trend towards a greater proportion of fractures being seen in urgent treatment/ walk-in centres rather than emergency departments.

It could be hypothesised that if the proportion of fractures seen in the emergency department continues to decrease that the opportunities to increase manipulations of fractures in the emergency department could become more limited over time.

## Summary of management of fractures

Those presenting at night and at weekends were more likely to have follow up appointments and have their fracture manipulated in theatre. While it may be that those with more obviously/complex fractures that require manipulation or follow up may be more likely to present at these times, rather than perhaps waiting until the next day, it is likely also the result of less senior staff available at these times. 

Those attending urgent treatment centres are more likely to have their fractures manipulated in theatre as this would likely not be possible at an urgent treatment centre. There is a trend for more fractures to be seen in urgent treatment centres, and while it appears that most of the fractures requiring manipulation are seen in ED rather than UTCs, a continued trend to seeing more fractures in UTCs may in the future impact the ability of trusts to further move away from manipulations in theatre.

We find the overall manipulation rate for forearm fractures has reduced over the last 6 years, this likely reflects a change in the culture, with displaced fractures now less likely to be manipulated. Indeed, the CRAFFT study is currently looking at whether there is a difference in outcomes between surgical reduction versus non-surgical casting for displaced distal radius fractures in children^1^.

<br>

Includes only NHS trusts that had a total of number of attendances for fractures of over 120 in 2022/23; this resulted in 8 trusts being excluded. Some trusts may have low numbers due to alternative provisions locally e.g. Royal Liverpool had small numbers which is unsurprising given its proximity to a specialist paediatric provision at Alder Hey. Independent providers were also excluded, that majority of these had small numbers of attendances for fractures, i.e. <120 per year.

All attendances at urgent treatment centres are costed at £85 regardless on whether a fracture is x-rayed.

For both Clavicle and Toe fractures without an X-ray the median cost of an emergency department attendance is £`r median_without_xray$cost` compared to a median cost of £`r median_with_xray$cost` when the fracture is x-rayed, suggesting a saving of £`r difference` for each clavicle or toe fracture not x-rayed in the emergency department.

For both Clavicle and Toe fractures without an X-ray the median cost of an emergency care attendance is £`r median_without_xray` compared to a median cost of £`r median_with_xray` when the fracture is X-rayed, giving a difference of `r difference`

So an annual reduction in Clavicle and Toe X-rays of `r format(total_xray_no, big.mark=",")` would equate to a saving of £`r total_xray_no*difference`

## Comparing GIRFT/Model Hospital metric to our data- 2022/23 {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.small}
Firstly, there are some significant differences between the data included by GIRFT/Model Hospital and the data used in this study, GIRFT/Model Hospital:

  -  include all forearm and wrist fractures, whereas we excluded certain fracture types, e.g open fractures which are assumed to all require treatment in theatre. 
  
-  include re-manipulations in theatre, whilst we have excluded these.

-  use a 3-year average, whilst we used only the most recent year where follow-up data is available (2022/23).

The GIRFT/Model Hospital metric uses the total A&E attendances for those aged 16 and under as the denominator. However, since we find incidence rates vary by region, it is likely the proportion of A&E attendances for fractures also vary by region. Therefore to determine variability by trust we using the number of each fracture type as the denominator.

## Using fracture number vs total emergency department attendances as the denominator {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

::: {.small}
Using the GIRFT/Model Hospital denominator of A&E attendances The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust has a manipulation rate of ~16.6 forearm manipulations/10,000 A&E attendances, putting it the 4th quartile with the 10th highest rate. Using our metric with the number of forearm fractures as the denominator we find 5.9% of forearm fractures are manipulated in theatre, putting The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust within the 3rd quartile (39th highest). This is unsurprising given the Cornwall ICB area has a high forearm fracture rate compared to many other regions.

Conversely, Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust is in one of the ICB areas with the lowest forearm fracture rates. Using the GIRFT metric this trust has 3.1 manipulations per 10,000 A&E attendances, putting it within the 2nd quartile (41st lowest). With our metric it has 5.1% of fractures manipulated in theatre and is within the 3rd quartile.

At Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust forearm fractures make up 2.8% of all emergency department attendances, while at Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust forearm fractures make up just 0.6% of attendances.

Generally, there are greater discrepancies between the 2 metrics at the higher end, with a greater proportion of manipulations in theatre.

## Limitations

Some of the variability in the number of fractures, x-rays, physiotherapy referrals, follow-up appointments and manipulations in both theatre and the emergency department could be due to issues with the coding/reporting. For example the number of elbow manipulations recorded in theatre is much lower than would be expected.

## Notes

Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, has one of the low proportions of forearm fractures manipulated in theatre, 0.5% in 2022/2023 (while 11.81%	were manipulated in the emergency department) meaning only 4% of all forearm manipulations where done in theatre. In term of follow-up appointments 57% of forearm fractures receive a follow-up appointment, which is just above the lowest quartile.
