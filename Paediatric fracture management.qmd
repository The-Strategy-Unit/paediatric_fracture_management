## Background (continued) {background-image="slide.png" background-size=contain}

#### Epidemiology of paediatric fractures 

::: {.small}
One hospital in Ireland calculated a paediatric fracture incidence rate of approximately 29 fractures/1,000/year^1^. The most common fracture was distal radial/buckle fractures (27.2%), followed by distal humerus /supracondylar fracture (13.9%), ankle fractures (9.2%), phalanx fractures (8.3%), and radial/ulnar metaphysis fractures (5.7%). It is suggested the incidence rate will depend on the social emphasis on encouraging physical activity^1^. 

Between 2012--2019, 368,120 children under 18 were admitted to English NHS hospitals with a fracture; 256,008 (69.5%) were upper limb and 85,737 (23.3%) were lower limb fractures^2^. The annual incidence of upper limb fractures was highest in children aged 5--9 (348.3 per 100 000 children).
:::

#### Paediatric fracture management 
::: {.small}
British Society for Children's Orthopaedic Surgery (BSCOS) guidance suggests that no referral/follow up is required for many fractures of the clavicle, elbow, wrist and toes where there is no or minimal displacement^3^. 

The FORCE study found in children with a torus fracture of the distal radius there was no difference in outcomes between those who were offered of a bandage and immediate discharge (as per UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommendations) and those receiving current treatment of rigid immobilisation and follow-up^4^. 

One study in Scotland found that uncomplicated paediatric clavicle fractures can be managed without x-rays in the ED as they do not influence ultimate management or add valuable information to clinicians' assessment^5^.

## Background (continued) {background-image="slide.png" background-size=contain}


#### Manipulation of paediatric fractures
::: {.small}
A GIRFT report on Paediatric Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery found that over 250 weeks of operating time a year had been dedicated to manipulation of the forearm and wrist between 2016 and 2019^1^. A significant proportion of these displaced or angulated wrist fractures could have been manipulated and cast in the emergency department rather than being admitted and treated in the operating theatre. The GIRFT report found significant variation between trusts in the number of manipulating being performed in theatre; if this number was reduced to the level in trusts with well-developed ED manipulation protocols, there would be an 80% (equivalent this number could be reduced by 80% (to 57 weeks or less). 

Due to pressures on hospitals from the COVID-19 pandemic the British Orthopaedic Association developed guidelines for the early management of distal forearm fractures in children. A study conducted at one trust found following the implementation of these guidelines resulted in 86% of distal forearm fractures in children were manipulated in the ED, an increase from 32% prior to the COVID pandemic^2^. This saved approximately 63 hours of theatre time in the six-month study period. 

The GIRFT report highlighted reluctance to perform procedures in the emergency department because of worries about breach times, a lack of space/facilities to perform sedation and a lack of familiarity with techniques^1^.

## Aims {background-image="slide.png" background-size=contain}

<br>

1)  Update and add to the information in the literature on the epidemiology/incidence rate of various paediatric fractures (toe, clavicle, wrist and elbow) in England.

2)  Understand the trends in management of these fracture types over time, e.g. have changes in guidance during COVID-19 changed the trends in management of fractures in Emergency departments.

3)  Investigate the variation in management of these fracture types between Trusts, and the potential activity and cost savings if there was more widespread conservative management, such as reducing unnecessary follow-ups appointments and manipulation in the Emergency Department rather than in theatre.

Tibia/Fibula fractures are most common in those aged 0-4 years

Elbow fractures are most common in those aged 5-10 years

In the 11-16 year old age group all fracture types are more common in males compared to females, with males aged 11-16 yrs ols having the highest incidence of clavicle, forearm and toe fractures.

There is a trend towards a greater proportion of fracture being seen in urgent treatment/ walk-in centres rather than emergency departments. 

It could be hypothesised that if a smaller proportion of fractures continue to be seen in the emergency department that the opportunities to increase manipulations of fractures in the emergency department could become more limited over time.

The percentage of fractures manipulated in theatre is higher for those attending emergency departments, suggesting those with more obviously/complex fractures are more likely to attend emergency departments, or be sent there from urgent treatment centres (in a small number of cases where a child attended 2 emergency care sites on the same day, we have only included the second attendance).

Includes only trusts in our dataset that had a total of number of attendances for fractures of over 120 in 2022/23; this excluded mainly independent providers, and a small number of trusts that likely have small numbers due to alternative paediatric provision locally, e.g. Royal Liverpool which is close to Alder Hey.

::: {.column width="40%"}

These proportions are slightly lower than seen in the GIRFT study, the discrepancy is likely because they included all forearm and wrist fractures, whereas we have excluded open fractures, which are assumed to all require manipulation in theatre. Also, GIRFT include re-manipulations in theatre whilst we have excluded these.

GIRFT uses the total A&E attendances as the denominator, but we find that the incidence rates vary by area and hence the proportion of A&E attendances due to fractures may be different in different areas, so to determine variability by trust using the number of each fracture type as the denominator may be more appropriate.

Those attending in more recent years were less likely to have a follow-up appointment, further indicating their has been a move towards fewer follow-up appointments.

tar_read(table_manipulation_regression_forearm) 

```
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
Includes only forearm fractures that are manipulated in either the emergency department or in theatre to determine what factors might be influencing the decision to manipulate a fracture in theatre rather than in the emergency department.

Children are more likely to have a fracture manipulated in theatre if they are

- female

- under the age of 5

- white

- from a more deprived area

They are also more likely to have a manipulation in theatre if they attended

- an urgent treatment centre

- on a weekend

- at nighttime

- in the summer 

Those attending in more recent years were less likely to have their fracture manipulated in theatre, further indicating their has been a move towards manipulating more fractures in the emergency department.
