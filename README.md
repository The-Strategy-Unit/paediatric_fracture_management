# NHP Paediatric Fracture Management

This project is aiming to:

1) Update and add to the information in the literature on the incidence rate of paediatric fractures (forearm, elbow, clavicle, tibia/fibula and toe) recorded in emergency care departments in England.

2) Understand the trends in management of these fracture types over time, e.g. have changes in guidance during COVID-19 changed the trends in management of fractures in Emergency departments.

3) Investigate the variation in management of these fracture types between Trusts, and the potential activity and cost savings if there was more widespread conservative management, such as reducing unnecessary follow-ups appointments and manipulation in the Emergency Department rather than in theatre. 


This work will determine the magnitude of any potential reduction in activity that could be achieved with more conservative management of certain paediatric fractures.
