# NHP Paediatric Fracture Management

This project is aiming to:

1) Update and add to the information in the literature on the epidemiology/incidence rate of various paediatric fractures (toe, clavicle, wrist and elbow) in England.

2) Understand the trends in management of these fracture types over time, e.g. have changes in guidance during COVID-19 changed the trends in management of fractures in Emergency departments.

3) Investigate the variation in management of these fracture types between Trusts, and the potential activity and cost savings if there was more widespread conservative management, such as reducing unnecessary follow-ups appointments and manipulation in the Emergency Department rather than in theatre. 


This work will determine the magnitude of any potential reduction in activity that could be achieved with more conservative management of certain paediatric fractures, which could allow the creation of a new activity mitigator in the New Hospital Programme (NHP) model to allow Trusts to estimate the impact of adopting conservative management of certain paediatric fractures on their future activity levels.
