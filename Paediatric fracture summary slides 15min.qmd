## Rationale {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

GIRFT report found some trusts were manipulating more displaced forearm
fractures in the emergency department rather than in theatre. If more
trusts adopted this, more conservative, approach to fracture management
a significant amount of theatre time could be saved^1^.

Many uncomplicated paediatric clavicle fractures can be managed without
x-rays^2^, and this is also considered true for toe fractures.

British Society for Children's Orthopaedic Surgery (BSCOS) guidance
suggests that no referral/follow up is required for many fractures of
the clavicle, elbow, wrist and toes where there is no or minimal
displacement^3^.

So, there is interest in understanding what the potential reductions in
activity could be if trusts were to implement more conservative
management of paediatric fractures and potential for an new mitigator in
the NHP model.

## Methodology {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

The study population included those:

\- who had attended an emergency department/urgent treatment centre in
England between April 2019 and March 2024 AND

\- were aged 16 and under AND

\- had a SNOMED code for **closed** fractures of toe, clavicle, elbow,
forearm or tibia/fibula recorded

<br>

Emergency care dataset (ECDS) linked with records in the Outpatient
(OPA) and Admitted Patient Care Episode (APCE) datasets.

<br>

The coding of fractures is not sufficiently detailed and reliable to
determine specific fracture types, and thus what would be the
appropriate treatment at an individual patient level. However, we could
calculate the proportion of children with each fracture type that:

-   **had an X-ray in the emergency department**
-   **received a follow-up appointment**
-   had a fracture manipulated in theatre (only includes closed
    manipulations and not re-manipulations)
-   had a fracture manipulated in the emergency department

:::
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
<br>

The majority of fractures are recorded under just a few snomed codes.

<br> 'Closed fracture of radius (disorder)' will likely include some
proximal radius fractures that would be more accurately classified at
elbow fractures.

<br> Fractures of great toe were excluded, as these should be followed
up. However these codes are not really used, suggesting great toe
fractures may be coded as 'Closed fracture of phalanx of foot
(disorder)' and thus included within our dataset.

<br>

Children are more likely to be given a follow-up appointment if they are

-   male

-   11-16 yrs old

-   from an asian or black background

-   living in a less deprived area

They are also more likely to have a follow-up appointment if they
attended

-   an emergency department

-   on a weekend

-   at nighttime

Those attending in more recent years were less likely to have a
follow-up appointment, further indicating there has been a move towards
fewer follow-up appointments.

## Summary of management of fractures {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

::: extrapad
::: summarytext
Over the last 5 years

-   No change in the proportion of fractures being x-rayed.

-   Slight reduction in the proportion of fractures being followed up,
    but significant increase in the proportion that are conducted
    virtually.

-   The proportion of forearm fractures manipulated in theatre has
    decreased while the proportion manipulated in the emergency
    department has increased. The overall manipulation rate for forearm fractures has reduced over
    the last 5 years.

Overall, there is a trend towards more conservative management of
paediatric fractures.

<br> This includes all outpatient attendances, including physiotherapy
appointments, in the 3 months post-fracture.

There is significant variability between trusts in the number of
follow-up appointments for clavicle fractures.

Many clavicle fractures should not require follow-up yet some trusts are
averaging 2-3 follow-up appointments per clavicle fracture, indicating a
potential to further decrease follow-up appointments if second and
subsequent appointments are considered.

## Differences between our approach and the GIRFT metric {background-image="slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="100%"}
We have also considered manipulations but there are some significant differences between the data included by
GIRFT/Model Hospital and the data used in this study. Our analysis:

-   excluded certain fracture types, e.g open fractures which are
    assumed to all require treatment in theatre.

-   excluded any activity coded as re-manipulations.

-   used only the most recent year where follow-up data is available
    (2022/23)

-   **links emergency care data to inpatient data and so we are only
    considering manipulations in theatre for patients identified in the
    emergency care dataset as having a fracture.**

GIRFT metric does not account for any regional differences in fractures
rates, but it is unaffected by the poor recording of diagnoses codes in
emergency care.

Our measure accounts for regional differences, but does rely on the
assumption that the fractures requiring interventions and those that do
not are equally likely have a diagnosis code recorded in emergency care.

Graphs show our data for the number of forearm fractures manipulated in
theatre in 2022/2023 (identified by linking to emergency care fracture
records), but use different denominators to calculate the rate.

**Top figure** shows the 20 trusts with the highest (red) and 20 trusts
with the lowest (green) rates of manipulations in theatre using total
A&E attendances as the denominator.

**Bottom figure** uses the number of A&E attendances for forearm
fractures as the denominator, and the same trusts labelled above are
shown in their new positions according to this new metric.

Example 1, using total A&E attendances as the denominator The Royal
Cornwall Hospitals Trust has the 11th highest rate of forearm
manipulation in theatre in England, but the trust moves out of the worst performing quartile (to 43rd highest) when using the number of forearm
fractures as the denominator.

Example 2, Conversely Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation trust doesn't perform as well as first thought moving out of the lowest quartile (16th lowest) to the 42nd highest, with a similar rate to The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust.

However, overall the majority of trusts remain within the same quartile regardless of the way the measure is calculated.

-   It is possible some of our numbers may be underestimates due to some
    issues with coding/reporting especially as diagnoses codes are not
    always recorded in the emergency care dataset. For example the
    number of manipulations of elbow fractures in theatre is considered
    low, this may be a coding issue or related to the inability from the
    coding to determine which radial fractures should be classed as
    elbow rather than forearm fractures.

-   Our incidence rates are for closed fractures only, open fractures,
    pathological fractures and birth trauma fractures were excluded.

-   Coding of fractures is not specific enough to determine at an
    individual level which fractures could be managed more
    conservatively, so we are relying on comparing proportion between
    trusts. Some fractures will be more complex and require manipulation
    and follow-up, but we can't be sure whether all trusts have a
    similar proportion of more complex fractures.

-   Only closed manipulations without internal fixation are included in
    our data, so if some trusts are treating a higher proportion of
    fractures with internal fixation then their rate of closed
    manipulations could appear lower. We have also not included
    re-manipulations in our data.

-   There will be a small number of cases where a child has more than
    one fracture or other injuries.

-   It should be noted is that data is allocated to the trust where the
    child attended the emergency department, but where they were
    followed-up if that is different
